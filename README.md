# Arduino-OLED
Check PagerDuty on your ESP8266 and SSD1306 powered display
Instructions

I use an ESP8266 Chip with Wifi and an 0.96" OLED display with SPI to display open incidents on PagerDuty.
Needed Libraries

    WifiManager
    SSD1306 display library from squix78
    ArduinoJson

Setup
Within the code you need to add PagerDutyDomain and PagerDutyToken with your PagerDuty settings. Compile it, deploy it, setup Wifi.
